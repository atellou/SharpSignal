Sharp Signal is an initiative focused on the research, development, and deployment of alpha strategies for non-institutional investors. 

## What's an alpha?
We like a less formal, different from the academic definition: A combination of mathematical expressions and code that can 
be used to make tradable predictions on the markets, based on available data. By 2019, at least 92% of the equity trade 
volume worldwide is executed by some type of algorithm.

## We believe local talent can succeed in global markets
Democratization of computing power, math, data science and platforms, create opportunities for talent with traditional non-finnancial backgrounds, 
who might be currently limited by the jobs they can find domestically.

 - **Markets will always be appealing**: Far from perfect, markets are a fascinating invention. Always evolving, they allow millions of people to invest in 
 hundreds of thousands of instruments reflecting all aspects of assets and world economies.
 - **Lots of data, technologies and tools**: Easy and cheap access to data and computing tools, are an irresistible combination for curiosity and experimentation
 in an attempt to beat the benchmarks. Like alchemists in ancient times, we might not reach the ultimate goal but learn a lot on the way.
 - **For retail investors, not for institutional or big money**: We strive for a boutique size success. Looking for small capacity strategies, 
 innovative opportunities in non-traditional markets and instruments. All without any institutional pressure or constraint.
